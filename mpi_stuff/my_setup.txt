ETH0_ADDRESS_HERE = ip of eth0 inside wsl(do ifconfig).
DESKTOP_IPCONFIG_IP_HERE = ip on desktop host(do ipconfig).

1. dummy interface with the ip of the desktop host.
    then we add some nat stuff so packets from wsl with the desktop ip get routed to the outside.
    and vice verca.

    commands inside desktop wsl:
    ip link add name dummy0 type dummy
    ip addr add DESKTOP_IPCONFIG_IP_HERE/32 dev dummy0 
    ip link set dev dummy0 up

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d ETH0_ADDRESS_HERE/32 -i eth0 -j DNAT --to-destination DESKTOP_IPCONFIG_IP_HERE
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s DESKTOP_IPCONFIG_IP_HERE/32 -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source ETH0_ADDRESS_HERE

2. port forward certain port ranges from desktop to wsl.
    have to do this cus im on windows bruv idk.
    I did this because the worker nodes use these ports to communicate to the desktop-wsl.

    run this in powershell on desktop.
    netsh interface portproxy set v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectaddress=ETH0_ADDRESS_HERE listenport=30000-65535
    netsh interface portproxy set v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectaddress=ETH0_ADDRESS_HERE listenport=10000-10100
